# Quantum-Computing-Journey
My 1 month self exploration journey to step into Quantnum Computing using Qiskit,Python,Math and Projects
=======
- ✅ Completed Phase 1 of my Quantum Journey (4 Weeks)
- ⏸️ Paused temporarily for academic priorities – will resume someday

## What I accomplished/Learned
- Learned about Quantum computing and Qiskit
- Improved Python
- Deeper level of maths and physics understanding
- Made projects like BB84,Grover's Algortihm,Quantum Teleportation etc

## Notes For Future self
- Advanced level of Qiskit
- Exploring concepts like Shor's Algorithm
- Build further real life applications based projects like cryptograhpy 
- Deeper understanding of maths and physics

# Quantum Computing Journey 🚀

This repository tracks my one-month study plan to learn Python, Linear Algebra, and Quantum Computing.

## Week 1 Highlights
- Python For Everybody – up to Lists
- Linear Algebra: Vectors (Khan Academy)
- Installed Qiskit, ran 101 tutorial
- Basics of Quantum Info: Single Systems
## Week 2 Highlights
- Completed Python For Everybody 
- Completed Basics of Quantum Info(Badge Earned)
- Ran various Implentation of above course on Qiskit
- Built Circuit On Quantum Teleportation,Superdense Coding and CHSH game
## Week 3 Highlights
- Sick, Not much progress:(
- Completed "Quantum Computing For The Very Curious"
- Made Mini project Quantum Teleportation,Superdense Coding
## Week 4 Highlights
- Revised vectors and matrices
- Built BB84 protocol
- Cleaned my "Projects" folder for better clarity

- Decided to pause it here to focus academics and job prep
